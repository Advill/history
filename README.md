# History

This is an attempt at recording the history of the JMU Unix Users Group.
Currently, we maintain a list of current and previous [officers](Officers.md)
broken down by year. For some years, other notable events in UUG history are
listed.

Current and previous members are invited to add themselves in the list of
[members](Members.md) by filling their information into the table.

The constitution of the Unix Users Group is maintained in a separate
[dedicated repository](https://github.com/jmunixusers/constitution).
